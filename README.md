# School Board DAO - README

## Vision

The School Board DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is designed to enhance governance in educational institutions by integrating blockchain technology. Our vision is to create a transparent, democratic, and efficient system for school board operations. By enabling decentralized decision-making and secure voting, we aim to empower all stakeholders, including parents, teachers, and administrators, to actively participate in shaping their educational environment.
